    "In this section, I use the TfidfVectorizer and TruncatedSVD functions to perform latent semantic analysis (LSA) on my abstracts. Essentially, LSA calculates a term-document frequency matrix and then factorizes it into three component matrices using singular value decomposition (SVD). This yields a matrix where each word is defined as a linear combination of the abstracts, a matrix where each abstract is a linear combination of words and a weight matrix of eigenvalues. The truncatedSVD function essentially retains only a limited number of components from the full factorization, hypothesized to represent the most relevant/latent components from the corpus."

       "      <th>A variety of experimental evidence indicates that the memory representation for multiplication facts (e.g., 6 ? 9 = 54) incorporates bidirectional links with a forward association from factors to product and a reverse association from product to factors. Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 ? 9 = ?) to factoring (54 = ? ? ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 = ? ? ?) facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 ? 9 = ?). In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.Ê\\n\\n</th>\n",

Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 ? 9 = ?) to factoring (54 = ? ? ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 = ? ? ?) facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 ? 9 = ?). In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.Ê</th>\n",

The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

This prediction was supported by two studies (total N = 96), which provided three tests involving two different spatial attention paradigms.

Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 ? 9 = ?) to factoring (54 = ? ? ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 = ? ? ?) facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 ? 9 = ?). In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.Ê\\n\\n</th>\n",

       "                                                    Recent evidence suggests that the processes responsible for generating a phonological code from print are\\nflexible in skilled readers. An important goal, therefore, is to identify the conditions that lead to changes\\nin how a phonological code is computed. Five experiments are reported that examine whether phonological\\nprocesses change as predicted by the pathway control hypothesis when reading aloud words and\\nnonwords. Changes in reading processes were assessed by measuring the effect of predictable switches\\nbetween stimulus categories across trials. The results of the present experiments are argued to be\\nconsistent with the pathway control hypothesis.\\n  \\\n",

       "                                                    A variety of experimental evidence indicates that the memory representation for multiplication facts (e.g., 6 ? 9 = 54) incorporates bidirectional links with a forward association from factors to product and a reverse association from product to factors. Surprisingly, the authors did not find evidence in Experiment 1 of facilitative transfer-of-practice from multiplication (6 ? 9 = ?) to factoring (54 = ? ? ?); in fact, multiplication practice produced item-specific interference with factoring. Similarly, the authors found no evidence in Experiment 2 that repetition of specific factoring problems (54 = ? ? ?) facilitated performance of corresponding multiplication problems (6 ? 9 = ?). In Experiment 3, participants practiced both multiplication and factoring and presented facilitative transfer in both directions. Thus, bidirectional facilitation occurred if both operations were practiced, but interference occurred when only one operation was practiced. We propose that this seemingly paradoxical behavior occurs because it is adaptive for the bidirectional retrieval structure to retain operational flexibility in the context of practicing both operations, whereas it is adaptive to specialize the memory representation for the practiced operation (i.e., factoring or multiplication) when only one operation is practiced.Ê\\n\\n  \\\n",

In one naming condition, the pictures and words were presented simultaneously on every\\ntrial, and participants produced the target response immediately. In the other naming condition, the\\npresentation of the picture preceded the presentation of the distractor by 1,000 ms, and participants\\ndelayed production of their naming response until distractor word presentation. Within each\\nnaming condition, the distractor words were either semantic category coordinates of the target\\npictures or unrelated. Orthogonal to this manipulation of semantic relatedness, the frequency of\\nthe picturesÕ names was manipulated. The authors observed semantic interference effects in both\\nthe immediate and delayed naming conditions but a frequency effect only in the immediate\\nnaming condition. These data indicate that semantic interference can be observed when target\\npicture naming latencies do not reflect the bottleneck at the level of lexical selection. In the\\ncontext of other findings from the pictureÐword interference paradigm, the authors interpret these\\ndata as supporting the view that the semantic interference effect arises at a postlexical level of\\nprocessing.\\n  \\\n",

We will propose that the answer to this question is yes and that the kinds of things easier to forget may provide important clues as to how intentional forgetting occurs. Such efforts are timely because there has been increasing interest in directed forgetting as part of a broader trend toward investigating inhibitory abilities. To date, published research has not addressed how recallability of an item influences the magnitude of directed forgettingÑthat is, if some things are easier to remember, how does the ease of remembering influence the magnitude of deliberate forgetting?\\n  \\\n",

       "                                                    Empirical evidence on selective exposure to information after decisions is contradictory: Whereas many studies have found a preference for information that is consistent with one's prior decision, some have found a preference for inconsistent information. The authors propose that different available information quantities moderate these contradictory findings. Four studies confirmed this expectation. When confronted with 10 pieces of information, decision makers systematically preferred decision-consistent information, whereas when confronted with only 2 pieces of information, they strongly preferred decision-inconsistent information (Study 1). This effect was not due to differences in processing complexity (Study 2) or dissonance processes (Study 3) but could be traced back to different salient selection criteria: When confronted with 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was information direction (consistent vs. inconsistent), which caused a preference for inconsistent information. In contrast, when confronted with more than 2 pieces of information, the salient selection criterion was expected information quality, which caused a preference for consistent information (Study 4).

Using a change detection task, the authors show that VWM\\nis subject to obligatory updating in the face of new information. Change detection performance is\\nenhanced when the item that may change is retrospectively cued 1 s after memory encoding and 0.5 s\\nbefore testing. The retro-cue benefit cannot be explained by memory decay or by a reduction in\\ninterference from other items held in VWM. Rather, orienting attention to a single memory item makes\\nVWM more resistant to interference from the test probe. The authors conclude that the content of VWM\\nis volatile unless it receives focused attention, and that the standard change detection task underestimates\\nVWM capacity.\\n  \\\n",

Three studies tested the hypothesis that descriptive deviants are more willing to express their opinions than either nondeviants or prescriptive deviants. Study 1 found that college students reported more comfort in expressing descriptive deviant opinions because descriptive deviance induced feelings of superior conformity (i.e., being \"different but good\"). Study 2 found that descriptive deviants reported more pride after expressing their opinions, were rated as more proud by an observer, and were more willing to publicize their opinions. Study 3 showed that political bumper stickers with descriptive deviant messages were displayed disproportionately more frequently than were those with prescriptive deviant messages.Ê\\n\\n  \\\n",

The authors evaluated several possible versions of the inhibition hypothesis by comparing\\nmonolinguals and bilinguals with regard to stop signal performance, inhibition of return, and the\\nattentional blink. These three phenomena, it can be argued, tap into different aspects of inhibition.\\nMonolinguals and bilinguals did not differ in stop signal reaction time and thus were comparable in\\nterms of active-inhibitory efficiency. However, bilinguals showed no facilitation from spatial cues,\\nshowed a strong inhibition of return effect, and exhibited a more pronounced attentional blink. These\\nresults suggest that bilinguals do not differ from monolinguals in terms of active inhibition but have\\nacquired a better ability to maintain action goals and to use them to bias goal-related information.\\nUnder some circumstances, this ability may indirectly lead to more pronounced reactive inhibition\\nof irrelevant information.\\n  \\\n",

       "                                                    Results from 2 relational-priming experiments suggest the existence of an automatic analogical coordination between semantic and arithmetic relations. Word pairs denoting object sets served as primes in a task that elicits \"obligatory\" activation of addition facts (5 + 3 activates 8; J. LeFevre, J. Bisanz, & L. Mrkonjic, 1988). Semantic relations between the priming words were either aligned or misaligned with the structure of addition (M. Bassok, V. M. Chase, & S. A. Martin, 1998). Obligatory activation of addition facts occurred when the digits were primed by categorically related words (tulips-daisies), which are aligned with addition, but did not occur when the digits were primed by unrelated words (hens-radios, Experiment 1) or by functionally related words (records-songs, Experiment 2), which are misaligned with addition. These findings lend support to the viability of automatic analogical priming (B. A. Spellman, K. J. Holyoak, & R. G. Morrison, 2001) and highlight the relevance of arithmetic applications to theoretical accounts of mental arithmetic.   \\\n",

We explored these questions using a phenomenon in which temporal selection goes\\nawry. In the attentional blink, subjects fail to report the second of a pair of targets (T1 and T2)\\nwhen they are presented at stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) of roughly 200 to 500 ms. We\\ndirectly tested the properties of temporal selection during the blink by analyzing distractor\\nintrusions at a fast rate of item presentation. Our analysis shows that attentional selection is (a)\\nsuppressed, (b) delayed, and (c) diffused in time during the attentional blink. These effects are\\ndissociated by their time course: The measure of each effect returns to the baseline value at a\\ndifferent SOA. Our results constrain theories of the attentional blink and indicate that temporal\\nselection varies along at least three dissociable dimensions: efficacy, latency, and precision.\\nSelective attention is the process of choosing a subset of the sensory input for detailed perceptual\\nanalysis. Although most research on attention has focused on the ability to select locations in\\nspace and the objects that occupy them, people can also select moments in time and the events that\\nunfold over them. In the experiment reported here, we investigated the nature of temporal\\nselection by testing a case in which it goes awry: the attentional blink (AB).\\n  \\\n",

       "                                                    A model of risk regulation is proposed to explain how low and high self-esteem people balance the\\ntension between self-protection and connectedness goals in romantic relationships. This model assumes\\nthat interpersonal risk automatically activates connectedness and self-protection goals. The activation of\\nthese competing goals then triggers an executive control system that resolves this goal conflict. One\\ncorrelational study and 8 experiments manipulating risk, goal strength, and executive strength and then\\nmeasuring implicit and explicit goal activation and execution strongly supported the model. For people\\nhigh in self-esteem, risk triggers a control system that directs them toward the situations of dependence\\nwithin their relationship that can fulfill connectedness goals. For people low in self-esteem, however, the\\nactivation of connectedness goals triggers a control system that prioritizes self-protection goals and\\ndirects them away from situations where they need to trust or depend on their partner.\\n  \\\n",

       "                                                    Previous research has shown that dominant individuals frequently think in terms of dominance hierarchies, which typically invoke vertical metaphor (e.g., ÒupperÓ vs. ÒlowerÓ class). Accordingly, we predicted that in spatial attention paradigms, such individuals would systematically favor the vertical dimension of space more than individuals low in dominance. This prediction was supported by two studies (total N = 96), which provided three tests involving two different spatial attention paradigms. In all cases, analyses controlling for speed of response to horizontal spatial probes revealed that more dominant individuals were faster than less dominant individuals to respond to probes along the vertical dimension of space. Such data support the metaphor-representation perspective, according to which people think in metaphoric terms, even in on-line processing tasks. These results have implications for understanding dominance and also indicate that conceptual metaphor is relevant to understanding the cognitive-processing basis of personality.\\n\\n  \\\n",

       "                                                    In 5 experiments, results showed that when participants are faced with materials embedding relations\\nbetween both adjacent and nonadjacent elements, they learn exclusively the type of relations they had to\\nactively process in order to meet the task demands, irrespective of the spatial contiguity of the paired\\nelements. These results are consonant with current theories positing that attention is a necessary condition\\nfor learning. More important, the results provide support for a more radical conception, in which the joint\\nattentional processing of 2 events is also a sufficient condition for learning the relation between them. The\\nwell-documented effect of contiguity could be a by-product of the fact that attention generally focuses\\non contiguous events. This reappraisal considerably extends the scope of approaches based on associative\\nor statistical processes.\\n  \\\n",

One answer, which has been highlighted in\\nemotion-regulation research, is that individuals are motivated\\nby short-term hedonic goals (e.g., the motivation to\\nfeel pleasure). Another answer, however, is that individuals\\nare motivated by instrumental goals (e.g., the motivation\\nto perform certain behaviors).We suggest that both\\nanswers have merit. To demonstrate the role instrumental\\ngoals may play in emotion regulation, we pitted short-term\\nhedonic motives and instrumental motives against each\\nother, by testing whether individuals were motivated to\\nexperience a potentially useful, albeit unpleasant, emotion.\\nWe found that (a) individuals preferred activities that\\nwould increase their level of anger (but not their level of\\nexcitement) when they were anticipating confrontational,\\nbut not nonconfrontational, tasks and that (b) anger improved\\nperformance in a confrontational, but not a nonconfrontational,\\ntask. These findings support a functional\\nview of emotion regulation, and demonstrate that in certain\\ncontexts, individuals may choose to experience emotions\\nthat are instrumental, despite short-term hedonic\\ncosts.\\n  \n",

When shape and color\\npairs were partially decoupled during learning, however, VSL operated over features: Observers expressed\\nrobust VSL when the feature dimensions were tested separately.

Errors were overwhelmingly reflections. This finding shows that the children failed to maintain color-location conjunctions. Performance improved when targets were accompanied by sentences specifying color and direction (e.g., Òthe red is on the leftÓ), but not when the conjunction was highlighted using a nonlinguistic cue (e.g., flashing, pointing, changes in size), nor when sentences specified a nondirectional relationship (e.g., Òthe red is touching the greenÓ).

In some phenomena, the amplitude of these waves varies in inverse relation to frequency. This pattern has been called 1/fÊnoise and, unlike white noise, it reflects nonrandom variation. Latencies in simple computer tasks typically reveal 1/fÊnoise, but the magnitude of the noise decreases as tasks become more challenging. The current work hypothesizes a correspondence between 1/fnoise and effort, leading to the prediction that increasing effort will reduce 1/fÊnoise. In 2 studies, the author examined the relationship between an individual's attempts to avoid bias (measured in Study 1, manipulated in Study 2) and 1/fÊnoise in implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice. In each study, participants who made an effort to modulate the use of racial information showed less 1/fÊnoise than did participants who made less effort. The potential value of this analytic approach to social psychology is discussed.Ê\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>We contrasted visual search for targets presented in prototypical views and targets presented in non-prototypical views, when targets were defined by their names and when they were defined by the action that would normally be performed on them. The likelihood of the first fixation falling on the target was increased for prototypical-view targets falling in the lower visual field. When targets were defined by actions, the durations of fixations were reduced for targets in the lower field. The results are consistent with eye movements in search being affected by representations within the dorsal visual stream, where there is strong representation of the lower visual field. These representations are sensitive to the familiarity or the affordance offered by objects in prototypical views, and they are influenced by action-based templates for targets.\\n\\n</td>\n",

We find that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, while the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three Experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level which lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene.

In the study reported here, listeners made same/different judgments on pairs of successive ÒchordsÓ (sums of pure tones with random frequencies). The change to be detected was always a frequency shift in one of the tones, and which tone would change was unpredictable.

Similar results were obtained when a chord was followed by a single tone that had to be judged as higher or lower than the closest component of the chord.

       "0  Recent studies of visual statistical learning (VSL) have demonstrated that statistical regularities in\\nsequences of visual stimuli can be automatically extracted, even without intent or awareness. Despite\\nmuch work on this topic, however, several fundamental questions remain about the nature of VSL. In\\nparticular, previous experiments have not explored the underlying units over which VSL operates. In a\\nsequence of colored shapes, for example, does VSL operate over each feature dimension independently,\\nor over multidimensional objects in which color and shape are bound together? The studies reported here\\ndemonstrate that VSL can be both object-based and feature-based, in systematic ways based on how\\ndifferent feature dimensions covary. For example, when each shape covaried perfectly with a particular\\ncolor, VSL was object-based: Observers expressed robust VSL for colored-shape sub-sequences at test\\nbut failed when the test items consisted of monochromatic shapes or color patches. When shape and color\\npairs were partially decoupled during learning, however, VSL operated over features: Observers expressed\\nrobust VSL when the feature dimensions were tested separately. These results suggest that VSL\\nis object-based, but that sensitivity to feature correlations in multidimensional sequences (possibly\\nanother form of VSL) may in turn help define what counts as an object.\\n  \n",

Errors were overwhelmingly reflections. This finding shows that the children failed to maintain color-location conjunctions. Performance improved when targets were accompanied by sentences specifying color and direction (e.g., Òthe red is on the leftÓ), but not when the conjunction was highlighted using a nonlinguistic cue (e.g., flashing, pointing, changes in size), nor when sentences specified a nondirectional relationship (e.g., Òthe red is touching the greenÓ).

       "0  Phenomena that vary over time can often be represented as a complex waveform. Fourier analysis decomposes this complex wave into a set of sinusoidal component waves. In some phenomena, the amplitude of these waves varies in inverse relation to frequency. This pattern has been called 1/fÊnoise and, unlike white noise, it reflects nonrandom variation. Latencies in simple computer tasks typically reveal 1/fÊnoise, but the magnitude of the noise decreases as tasks become more challenging. The current work hypothesizes a correspondence between 1/fnoise and effort, leading to the prediction that increasing effort will reduce 1/fÊnoise. In 2 studies, the author examined the relationship between an individual's attempts to avoid bias (measured in Study 1, manipulated in Study 2) and 1/fÊnoise in implicit measures of stereotyping and prejudice. In each study, participants who made an effort to modulate the use of racial information showed less 1/fÊnoise than did participants who made less effort.

The likelihood of the first fixation falling on the target was increased for prototypical-view targets falling in the lower visual field. When targets were defined by actions, the durations of fixations were reduced for targets in the lower field. The results are consistent with eye movements in search being affected by representations within the dorsal visual stream, where there is strong representation of the lower visual field. These representations are sensitive to the familiarity or the affordance offered by objects in prototypical views, and they are influenced by action-based templates for targets.\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "0  The joint effects of stimulus quality and word frequency in lexical decision were examined in 4\\nexperiments as a function of nonword type (legal nonwords, e.g., BRONE, vs. pseudohomophones, e.g.,\\nBRANE). When familiarity was a viable dimension for wordÐnonword discrimination, as when legal\\nnonwords were used, additive effects of stimulus quality and word frequency were observed in both\\nmeans and distributional characteristics of the response-time distributions. In contrast, when the utility of\\nfamiliarity was undermined by using pseudohomophones, additivity was observed in the means but not\\nin distributional characteristics. Specifically, opposing interactive effects in the underlying distribution\\nwere observed, producing apparent additivity in means. These findings are consistent with the suggestion\\nthat, when familiarity is deemphasized in lexical decision, cascaded processing between letter and word\\nlevels is in play, whereas, when familiarity is a viable dimension for wordÐnonword discrimination,\\nprocessing is discrete.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "0  The representation of visual information inside the focus of attention is precise relative to the representation of information outside the focus of attention. We find that the visual system can compensate for the cost of withdrawing attention by pooling noisy local features and computing summary statistics. The location of an individual object is a local feature, while the center of mass of several objects (centroid) is a summary feature representing the mean object location. Three Experiments showed that withdrawing attention degraded the representation of individual positions more than the representation of the centroid. It appears that information outside the focus of attention can be represented at an abstract level which lacks local detail, but nevertheless carries a precise statistical summary of the scene. The term Òensemble featuresÓ refers to a broad class of statistical summary features, which we propose collectively comprise the representation of information outside the focus of attention\\n\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                "

# Text Analysis of Scientific Abstracts

This repository contains analysis scripts and highlights from a project I completed in a Computational Linguistics class at Washington University in St Louis. The primary goal of this project was to evaluate the reproducibility of psychological research by applying text-based analysis to abstracts, and understand whether linguistic signatures in the abstracts could provide useful information about whether a study would be replicated or not.
